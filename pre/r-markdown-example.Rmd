# R Markdown
```{r readin}
minke <- read.csv('data/minke.csv',skip = 3)
```



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(minke)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(minke,aes(age,length)) + geom_point()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## More control
One can also use `eval = FALSE` to write code to the document that is not run:
```{r noeval, eval=FALSE}
## this plot is not created
ggplot(minke,aes(maturity)) + geom_bar()
```

If one doesn't want to run certain lines:
```{r partsrun, eval=c(1,3)}
x <- minke$length
plot(x)   ## this line doesn't run
hist(x)
```

Similarly if one wants to show certain lines:
```{r partshown, eval=TRUE, echo=c(1,3)}
x <- minke$length
ggplot(minke,aes(length)) + geom_histogram()
mean(x)
```

Negative indexing is also allowed:
```{r partshown2, eval=TRUE, echo=-2}
x <- minke$age
ggplot(minke,aes(age)) + geom_histogram()
mean(x,na.rm=TRUE)
```

## Producing tables
Tables can be produced using the kable command:
```{r mtable}
  minke %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(num = n()) %>%
  kable(caption='Num. whales caught by year')
```


## Figure control
Figure width and height can be controlled from the chunk options
```{r figdim, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
ggplot(minke,aes(stomach.volume)) + geom_histogram()
```

Figure alignment can also be set
```{r figdim2, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, fig.align='right'}
ggplot(minke,aes(stomach.volume)) + geom_histogram()
```

Captions can also be added:
```{r figdim3, fig.height=3, fig.width=5,fig.cap='Histogram of stomach volume'}
ggplot(minke,aes(stomach.volume)) + geom_histogram()
```

## More control of the output
Rmarkdown is fairly diligent with giving you warnings and errors in the R code when encountered:
```{r silent, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,error=FALSE}
ggplot(minke,aes(stomach.volume)) + geom_histogram()
```

## Formulas in Markdown
For those that know LaTeX this is fairly straightforward. Inline formulas are written as $w=al^b$ and equations in a newline by 
$$l = L_\infty*(1-e^{-k(a-t_0)})$$

## Inline R output)
One can also add output from R directly into text with: Numbers of minke whales are N = `r nrow(minke)`
